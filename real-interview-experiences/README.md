# My real interview questions

### Nov-Dec 2025

✅ Using Enum in Java, writean  abstract method to perform ADD, SUB, MUL
- Java Collections (List.of, Arrays.asList, Map, List, Set, Queue, Mutable vs Immutable, Thread safe, HashMap & ConcurrentHashMap) -> Internal Implementations
- Generics (to perform the add operation)
- Streams & Lambdas Combo
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Datastructures, Time Complexity, Searching, Sorting
- Microservices (Saga Pattern)
- CI/CD, SDLC, Agile, Scrum
- Write the Java code to get high freq chars from a string (Ex: mostFreq("abracadabrra", 2) must return ['a', 'r'])
- Write a query to get the top 10 venues sorted by number of bookings in the last 30 days. (where venues & bookings are two tables with venue_id as common)
- JVM Memory (Data Storage, Heap, in-depth concepts), Heap Memory, Garbage Collection
- HashMap, HashTable (how are duplicate keys handled? internal implementation, collisions, etc.)
- HashCode (how to avoid 2 objs having the same hash code)

 - ✅ How to create an immutable class in Java
 - ✅ What is try with resources
- How many default & static methods are in a functional interface?
- Lambda Expressions, Stream API (in-depth internal implementations like Splitterator)
- Multi-Threading (in-depth features, volatile keyword, thread pool), Java Concurrency API, race condition, round robin
- Design Patterns (Abstract, Factory, Builder, Observer)
- ✅  SOLID (Liskov substitution real-time implementation example in your project)
- Java 21 New Features (Ex, virtual threads)
- Datastructures (String manipulation: -> find the frequency of characters in string (top 2), -> find non-character, etc...) Tip: Use ChatGPT for various versions or types of these questions
- Do more coding syntax in Java (Implement code/poc on every concept you learn above)
- Kafka (partition key & offset, idempotency, in-depth questions), EDA - Event Driven Architecture, how to make sure a microservice will not consume a msg more than once?
- "record" in Java
- Multiple catch statements, exception classes order (exception hierarchies, GenericException)
- REST API (design, re-design, bad vs good API design aspects, best practices for rest api design)
- Agile vs Scrum vs Kanban
- Sprint planning/sprint capacity (hours vs man days)
- Kubernetes (pods, replicas, scale, etc.)
- SQL DB vs Java Memory (real-time production performance issues faced in your project)
- SQL to NOSQL transformation steps (schema, data, etc.)
- DBMS: Deadlocks
- Microservices Architecture (e.g., Saga, DB per service, etc.), how do you design from scratch? How do microservices communicate? (sync vs async, rest api call vs msg)
- Java 8 to Java 21 Features

✅ TDD vs BDD
